                    <p>Frankly, I find it a bit tricky to describe myself comprehensively in a few words.
                        However, I'll point out some my most dominant and fundamental aspects.

                            <p>
                                To start off, I am a very curious and skeptical lad. I focus on asking the 
                                right questions and approaching problems from the bottom up. 
                                <br><br>
                                Naturally I would prefer to be a leader rather than a follower, 
                                but I have no problem following instructions either. 
                                I work well with teams, even though I work better by myself.
                                <br><br>
                                I have an entreprenurial mindset and similarly,
                                I am wildy fascinated by the workings of the universe and the 
                                development of technologies such as AI and Robotics. I like to 
                                consider myself a physicist and a technologist.

                            <p>
                                I am a passionate and enthusiastic

                                I create user-friendly, reliable and responsive websites, 
                                with the latest web development technologies 
                                such as html 5, gasp, and javascript. 
                                <br><br>
                                I have strong attention to detail and I'm always looking 
                                new ways to optimize my customers' projects.
                                <br><br>
                                I am punctual and I always deliver my projects before 
                                due date.
